# LeggyTreeLib

## What?
A .NET Framework C# class library containing interface `ITreeNode<T>` and base class `TreeNode<T>` that will aid developers in implementing their own tree data structures. The library also contains an implementation of a BinaryTree which makes use of both TreeNode and ITreeNode to provide developers with a Binary Tree structure to use (as C# does not have one built in) as well as also providing an example of how to make use of ITreeNode and TreeNode for their own structures.

## Why?
Creating this library was a natural first step to me on the way to making these libraries as the .NET Framework provides no tree structure for me use as a starting point:
